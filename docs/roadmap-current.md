# Roadmap (Current)

## Now

- Keep protocol definitions consistent and compile-clean for all touched `.proto` files.
- Improve reference docs where protocol behavior is ambiguous or easy to misread.
- Maintain analysis tooling usability, especially APK indexing workflows and docs.

## Next

- Add tighter validation guidance for cross-file proto consistency checks.
- Expand protocol notes that connect live captures to field-level annotations.
- Improve contributor guidance for submitting focused, verifiable proto changes.

## Later

- Add optional language-generation examples beyond current quick-start snippets.
- Add a protocol change log format for tracking notable semantic updates.
- Explore lightweight automation for stale doc path/reference detection.

## Focus Guardrails

- This repo is not an app runtime project; avoid UI/runtime feature work here.
- Prioritize protocol definitions, protocol docs, and analysis tooling only.
- Defer cross-repo product planning to the primary application repository.
