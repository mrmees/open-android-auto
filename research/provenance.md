## Curation Notes

- The archive is intentionally copied as research evidence, including historical notes and partially resolved findings.
- Some archived docs refer to old paths, class names, or workflows in `openauto-prodigy`.
- Proto definitions in this repo are the canonical working set; archived research explains how those definitions were derived.
- Excluded at import: raw logcat dumps, large SQLite DB artifacts, and full decompiled APK source trees.
